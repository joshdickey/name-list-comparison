# name-list-comparison
When this script runs it looks in the same directory for two files. master.txt, remover.txt. it compares the files against each other and gives you all the names that are not on the master list and a list of all the names on both lists. 
NOTE. you must have both master.txt and remove.txt in the same directory as this script
Format for txt files are as follows

If you only have a FIRSTNAME or USERNAME you can tweak the code and use the format_names() function alone and not the getFirstLastName() function.
the format_names() function stips and tabs or cammas or newlines from the name 
Format for txt files are as follows if you dont have last names. 
USERNAME or FIRSTNAME
